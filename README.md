dleToWp
=======

Simple way to transfer all data from "DataLife Engine" to "Wordpress". Main feature of this plugin is that it doesnt just copy all stuff, but recreates / inserts all users, categories, posts and comments.


Dont forget to copy "/engine/classes/parse.class.php" file from "DataLife Engine" to current plugin directory as it uses it to parse post data.
